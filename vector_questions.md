    1. What’s the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors?
    1. Given a vector $u$ , find vector $v$  of unit length such that the dot product of $u$  and $v$  is maximum.
1. Outer product
    1. Given two vectors $a=[3,2,1]$  and $b=[−1,0,1]$. Calculate the outer product $a^Tb$ ?
    1. Give an example of how the outer product can be useful in ML.
1. What does it mean for two vectors to be linearly independent?
1. Given two sets of vectors $A=a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n$  and $B=b_1,b_2,b_3,...,b_m$. How do you check that they share the same basis?
