# Dimensionality Reduction Questions

1. Why do we need dimensionality reduction?
1. Eigendecomposition is a common factorization technique used for dimensionality reduction. Is the eigendecomposition of a matrix always unique?
1. Name some applications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
1. We want to do PCA on a dataset of multiple features in different ranges. For example, one is in the range $0-1$ and one is in the range $10 - 1000$. Will PCA work on this dataset?
1. Under what conditions can one apply eigendecomposition? What about SVD?
    1. What is the relationship between SVD and eigendecomposition?
    1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between PCA and SVD?
1. How does $t-SNE$ (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) work? Why do we need it?
